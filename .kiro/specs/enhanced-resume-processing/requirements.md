4. WHEN tracking applications THEN the system SHALL correlate resume versions with success rates
5. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide actionable insights and recommendations
6. WHEN viewing analytics THEN the system SHALL display trends and patterns in an intuitive dashboard

### Requirement 7: Privacy and Security for Document Processing

**User Story:** As a privacy-conscious user, I want my uploaded documents to be processed securely and deleted when no longer needed, so that my personal information remains protected.
