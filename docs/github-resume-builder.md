## Processing Steps

The GitHub resume generation follows these steps:

1. **Validation**: Validates GitHub username format and accessibility
2. **Profile Fetching**: Retrieves GitHub profile information
3. **Repository Analysis**: Analyzes repositories, languages, and metrics
4. **Skill Processing**: Categorizes and ranks technical skills
5. **Resume Generation**: Creates structured resume data

## Data Sources

### GitHub Profile Data
- Name, email, location, bio
- Public repository count
- Follower/following counts
- Account creation date
- Blog/website URL

### Repository Analysis
- Repository metadata (name, description, topics)
- Programming languages and usage statistics
- Star counts, fork counts, and activity metrics
- README presence and documentation quality
- Issue and pull request activity

### Contribution Patterns
- Commit history and frequency
- Pull request submissions and merges
- Issue creation and resolution
- Organization contributions
- Collaboration indicators

## Skill Categorization

### Languages
Detected from GitHub's language statistics and file analysis:
- JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, Go, Rust, C++, C#, PHP, Ruby, Swift, Kotlin, etc.

### Frameworks & Libraries
Identified from repository topics, descriptions, and dependencies:
- React, Vue.js, Angular, Next.js, Django, Flask, Spring, Laravel, etc.

### Tools & DevOps
Found in repository configurations and topics:
- Docker, Kubernetes, Git, Webpack, Babel, Jenkins, GitHub Actions, etc.

### Databases
Detected from project dependencies and descriptions:
- PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, Elasticsearch, etc.

### Cloud Platforms
Identified from deployment configurations and topics:
- AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, Vercel, Netlify, Heroku, etc.

### Testing Frameworks
Found in project dependencies and configurations:
- Jest, Vitest, Cypress, Playwright, JUnit, PyTest, etc.

## Estimation and Transparency

### [ESTIMATE] Tags
All GitHub-derived metrics are marked with [ESTIMATE] tags to maintain transparency:
- Impact statements based on repository metrics
- Skill proficiency levels
- Contribution quantifications
- Project complexity assessments

### Conservative Approach
- Uses conservative estimates for all metrics
- Only includes skills with clear evidence
- Omits sections with insufficient data rather than guessing
- Prioritizes accuracy over impressive numbers

## Error Handling

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### GitHub User Not Found
- **Cause**: Username doesn't exist or profile is private
- **Solution**: Check spelling, ensure profile is public

#### Rate Limit Exceeded
- **Cause**: Too many API requests
- **Solution**: Wait 1 hour before retrying

#### Limited GitHub Activity
- **Cause**: Few public repositories or minimal activity
- **Solution**: Make repositories public, add descriptions and topics

#### Network Connection Issues
- **Cause**: Internet connectivity problems
- **Solution**: Check connection, disable VPN, try again

### Retry Logic
- Automatic retry for transient errors
- Progressive backoff for rate limiting
- User-friendly error messages with suggestions

## Best Practices

### For Better Resume Quality

1. **Repository Optimization**
   - Make your best repositories public
   - Add comprehensive descriptions
   - Include relevant topics/tags
   - Maintain active README files

2. **Profile Enhancement**
   - Complete your GitHub profile information
   - Add a professional bio
   - Include your website/portfolio
   - Pin your best repositories

3. **Code Quality**
   - Use meaningful commit messages
   - Maintain consistent coding standards
   - Document your projects well
   - Include project screenshots or demos

### For Accurate Skill Detection

1. **Language Usage**
   - Use primary languages consistently
   - Avoid generated or boilerplate code in main branches
   - Keep language statistics representative of your skills

2. **Project Organization**
   - Use clear project structures
   - Include package.json, requirements.txt, or similar files
   - Tag repositories with relevant technologies

## Troubleshooting

### Performance Issues
- Large profiles (100+ repos) may take longer to process
- Consider reducing max repositories for faster processing
- Network speed affects processing time

### Quality Issues
- Ensure repositories have good descriptions
- Add topics to repositories for better categorization
- Keep profile information up to date
- Use meaningful repository names

### Technical Issues
