# OpenAI SDK Integration Fix

## Problem
The API was returning "Not Found" errors when trying to use the OpenRouter API with fetch requests.

## Root Cause
The manual fetch approach wasn't properly configured for OpenRouter's specific requirements.

## Solution
Switched to using the official OpenAI SDK with OpenRouter configuration as recommended in the OpenRouter documentation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Installed OpenAI SDK
```bash
npm install openai --legacy-peer-deps
```
(Used legacy peer deps to resolve zod version conflicts)

### 2. Updated API Routes

#### `app/api/resume/ai-analyze/route.ts`
- **Before**: Manual fetch with custom headers
- **After**: OpenAI SDK with proper OpenRouter configuration

```typescript
import OpenAI from 'openai';

const openai = new OpenAI({
  baseURL: "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
  defaultHeaders: {
    "HTTP-Referer": "https://ai-resume-coach.com",
    "X-Title": "AI Resume Coach",
  },
});

// Usage
const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "openai/gpt-oss-120b:free",
  messages: [...],
  temperature: 0.3,
  max_tokens: 2000
});
```

#### `app/api/resume/ai-enhance/route.ts`
- Applied the same OpenAI SDK integration
- Same configuration and usage pattern

### 3. Model Configuration
- **Model**: `openai/gpt-oss-120b:free`
- **Base URL**: `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`
- **API Key**: From environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- **Headers**: Proper HTTP-Referer and X-Title for OpenRouter

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Official SDK**: Uses the official OpenAI SDK which is maintained and tested
2. **Better Error Handling**: SDK provides better error messages and handling
3. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper types
4. **OpenRouter Compatibility**: Follows OpenRouter's recommended integration pattern
5. **Reliability**: More reliable than manual fetch requests

## Environment Configuration
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=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
OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
```

## Testing
✅ **Build Successful**: All components compile correctly
✅ **SDK Integration**: OpenAI SDK properly configured for OpenRouter
✅ **Model Access**: Using the correct free model `openai/gpt-oss-120b:free`

## Expected Result
The "Not Found" error should now be resolved, and the AI analysis and enhancement features should work properly with your OpenRouter API key.

## Next Steps
1. Test the analyze functionality in the tailor page
2. Test the enhance/tailor functionality
3. Verify AI responses are being generated correctly

The integration now follows OpenRouter's best practices and should resolve the API connectivity issues.
